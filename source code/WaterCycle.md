Introduction
===
- Water is naturally present in liquid, solid and gaseous states;
- Water one of the main influencers on our environment;
- Water is one of the most-used elements depending on location and potential use;
- Water is a cradle of the a life;
- No water – no life;

Distribution of water on Earth
===
- World Ocean covers 71% of Earth’s surface;
- Inland water cover 3.5% of the surface;
- The ration of water to land in 
- Nothern Hemisphere is 61:39;
- In Southern Hemisphere is 81:19;

Hydrosphere
===
- It is the water shell of the Earth;
- It includes all waters regardless of its state of aggregation;
- The overall volume of the hydrosphere is about 14 billion km<sup>3</sup>;
 - 96.5% - salty water of World Ocean;
 - 3.5% - fresh waters;
- 50% of fresh water is in the shape of ice;
 - 89.8% - Antarctica;
 - 9.7% – Greenland;
 - 0.5% - Arctic islands and mountain glaciers;
 
Hydrosphere
===
- Underground waters form 23.4 million km<sup>3</sup>, or 1.68% of the total volume on Earth;
- Living species contain water of more than 1000 km<sup>3</sup>;

Change in the amount of water on Earth
===
- Degassing of the mantle releases 0.5-1 km<sup>3</sup> anually;
- About 0.5 km<sup>3</sup> of water comes outer space;
- 1 km<sup>3</sup> dispresed into outer space;

Global Hydrological Cycle
===
- Hydrological cycle is a process of movement of water;
- It interacts with lithosphere, atmosphere and biosphere;
- It caused by solar energy and gravity;
- There are three types of water cycle: small, great and inland cycle;

Conclusion
===
- The importance of the water cycle in nature for our entire planet can hardly be overestimated;
- Water transports substances necessary for life;
- Water cycle purifies the water;
- Water cycle delivers water to the different regions of the Earth;
